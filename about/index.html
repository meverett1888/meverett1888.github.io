      <p>Hi, I’m Meg and this ‘about me’ page has given me more writer’s block than all of my blog posts combined. I am a preschool teacher from San Diego currently living in Edinburgh, Scotland. I love the ocean, stationary supplies, and breakfast food. I do not love large crowds, jogging for any reason, or bell peppers. I struggle with anxiety, panic disorder and depression. I started this blog as a place to share my stories in the hopes that even just one sentence will resonate with someone and make them feel less alone. Thank you for being here.</p>
