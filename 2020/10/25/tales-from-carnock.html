      <h1>Tales from Carnock</h1>
<small>25 October 2020</small>

<p>Today, I am doing my writing session outside. I can hear two tractors, and a variety of birds. I can smell wet leaves, and cow manure. I can see spiderwebs glinting in the grass. A seagull’s plaintive cry pierces the air, and is carried away on the breeze towards the sea. The lone bare tree on the hilltop maintains its vigil, casting its gnarly shadow over the field of freshly cut hay. I don’t really know what to write about next. I suppose I don’t necessarily have to produce a ‘piece’ in order to call my session a success. I’m retraining my brain to produce written words rather than just consume them. I’d wager that this document is going to remain “Untitled”.</p>

<p>Mrs. Long is looking for her lost ginger tabby, aptly named Garfield. Every evening, as the sun sets, she treks through the neighborhood shaking her bag of cat treats. Garfield is a no-show, so far. I have dreams of encountering him in the back garden and convincing him to follow me back to Number 47, much to the delight of the Long family. He’d be unlikely to cooperate, I feel. He’d give me that classic feline look, the one that says ‘you foolish human, I am certainly above you’. And I’d probably end up feeding him lunch meat and sending him on his way, perhaps with the gentle suggestion that he check-in with his servants in Number 47.</p>

<p>I can hear Mrs. Robb’s television blasting the news through the walls of her living room. My heart grows heavy when I think of what her life must be like as a widow in a rural town in a pandemic. I feel sick when I think of how I’ve ducked out of sight when she passes, too wary of the high-volume, lengthy, confused conversation that would follow if she spots me in the garden. She is a strong, interesting, kind woman who does not deserve the lonely cards that she’s been dealt.</p>

<p>The mushrooms that are nestled in the grass resemble discarded orange peels. Or maybe slices of slowly rotting banana. Unclear why I have only made food comparisons because they certainly do not look appetizing with their slimy skin and aquatic-looking gills. Though I suppose abandoned peels and browning banana skin are not appealing either.</p>

<p>What a random 28 minute snapshot, taken from my soggy, mossy bench. Perhaps this document should be re-christened “Tales from Carnock”.</p>
