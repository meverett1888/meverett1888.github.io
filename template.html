      <h1>The Everyday Monster</h1>
<small>3 October 2020</small>

<p>“I’m going to flip you like a penny, crumble you like a cracker and throw you away”, I recite for the fifteenth time as I pace another loop around the library, clutching my special hall pass signed by the school counselor. This secret mantra is drawn from <a href="http://google.com">the children’s book</a> The After-School Monster, which tells the tale of Luisa overcoming her fear and standing up to the big, hungry, horned beast who is hiding in her house when she arrives home from school. The monster chasing me around the empty halls of my middle school is my severe panic disorder and he is not just an after-school monster, or even just a during-school monster, he is an all-day everyday monster.</p>

<p>My everyday monster has been with me since I was 11 years old, and like Luisa’s monster, he was very large and very scary when he first arrived. Just as Luisa’s creature filled up her entire house, my panic disorder disrupted every aspect of my life, including the most basic human functions. He wouldn’t let me leave the house, and he wouldn’t let my mom leave me. He stood between me and my dad, and smothered my relationship with my brother. He crushed my lifelong love of school, and demolished my growing devotion to Tae Kwon Do. He said no to sleepovers, he said no to sleeping. He convinced me of many things- that I was seconds away from a stomach flu, that I was an open window away from being kidnapped, that I was simply going to die. He was strangling everything good and fun about being a kid, a daughter, being a sister, and a friend, and it seemed impossible that I’d be able to find Luisa’s courage to shrink him and stomp him right back.</p>

<p>These days, though, my everyday monster fits in my pocket for the most part. I gave him a really good crushing when I returned to school and thrived. I heartily squashed him when I left home to attend college. We had a battle for the ages when I was learning to drive, but I eventually threw him right out the window. When one of my students vomited at my feet on the playground, he grew back his horns but I gave him a swift kick and helped my little Elle feel better. He sprouts sharp claws whenever I find myself wringing my hands at sunset, and his teeth sharpen any time that I have a stomach ache. And, lately, the global situation has been his favorite daily nourishment. I may never truly throw him away like Luisa’s rotten banana peel, nor will he always stay conveniently pocket-sized. But I am just as strong as Luisa, and I will keep finding the courage to flip my everyday monster like a penny, crumble him like a cracker, and do my best to throw him away.</p>
